#Final Project:
##Project Description
##A Magic the Gathering application where you can view, store and trade cards between users.
##It will involve using the Magic: The Gathering API to retrieve information on the different cards in the game.


###3 Main Features
The ability to browser MTG cards by set
The ability to add cards to your profile favorites list
The ability to trade cards with other users

###Views and UI Description
The home view UI will consist of a form where can submit a query for information on a particular set. There will be links to the different ‘basic’ views such as a login page, sign-in page, and profile page. There will also be links to set views.

There will be an individual card page with an image of the card and relevant information such as type and effects.

The lists by set may be separate views with links to individual cards in that set.

There will be an account registration and sign-in page.

There will be a profile view where you can list card favorites and want lists. If time permits I may add a feature to build decks.
